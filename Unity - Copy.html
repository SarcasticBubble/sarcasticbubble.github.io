        <p>Duckies dungeon was my first foray into unity and game development. It was a solo assignment in my first year
          Unity class. Through it I was able to gain hands-on knowledge of a lot of the unity basics and C#. The premise
          of the game is simple: a duck has run out of bread and he must go on an adventure through a dungeon to get
          more. One day I would like to update this game and make it a proper dungeon crawler like my original vision
          but for now it is an example of what can be achieved with basic knowledge and a lot of determination. While
          lots of what I did in this game seems easy nowI was particularly proud of what I was able to achieve with the
          slow down traps and the following enemies. I was able to create both by repurposing code I had previously seen
          and manipulating it to fit my needs. </p>

          <p> I started OverGrown, a working title, as part of a game jam. Per the rules of the game jam all games had
            to be made individually and all assets had to be made by the competitors. Sadly I didn’t make it much
            further than creating assets and starting to implement code. As this was my first game jam and first time
            creating any sort of big project on my own in such a short period of time there was a lot I was able to
            learn from the experience.
            This
            failure to complete the game has given me a sense of how long things can truly take when it comes to game
            development but also a better sense of how time must be managed if I were to do something like this again.
            On the Unity side of things I was able to explore parts of the engine I had never used before. I was able to
            create layered tile maps for easy level building. I learned how to build a camera that smoothly follows the
            player through different areas while still remaining in bounds. The newest thing to me in this project is
            state machines, which seemed very daunting at first, but I how have an apprication for what they are able to
            do and
            their role in unity game development.</p>
